# tailscale-ui
A basic Linux (Ubuntu) client for tailscale. This was built in an attempt to make managing tailscale in linux easier.

Goals:

- Turn on / off device tailscale
- Add tray icon
- Allow setting device as access point
- See list of all devices (names/ ip) in clean way. Color code if device is online or not.
- Search for device by name or IP
- Switch tailscale network device is connected to (system should allow drop down if one has already be added)
- Allow adding a new network
